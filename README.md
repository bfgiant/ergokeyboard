# Ergokeyboard
Tracking my progress developing an ergonomic keyboard layout inspired by the Ergodox, Atreus, and Iris keyboards
The 2D keyboard layout is designed in OpenSCAD, with the intention of exporting the cutout locations to Autodesk Fusion360 to design the case.

### Specs:
- ~54 keys (this changes often)
- Staggered columns
- Split & Rotated Halves (8.5 degrees from the horizontal)

### Progress:
- Layout

  - [ ] Paper Prototyping
- Case
